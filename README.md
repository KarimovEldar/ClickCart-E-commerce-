## Libraries and technologies used

- **Navigation Component**: We leverage the Navigation Component to streamline navigation within the app. One activity hosts multiple fragments, making the app structure efficient and easy to manage.

- **Firebase Authentication**: We use Firebase Auth to manage user accounts, handle login and registration, and ensure a secure authentication process.

- **Firebase Firestore**: For data storage, we rely on Firebase Firestore, a real-time NoSQL database. This enables efficient data management for the system.

- **Firebase Storage**: Images, including product images and user profile pictures, are stored securely in Firebase Storage.

- **MVVM & LiveData**: Our architecture follows the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, keeping logic and views separate. LiveData is used to handle data changes and maintain state even when screen configurations change.

- **Coroutines**: We employ Coroutines to execute background tasks efficiently, ensuring smooth performance and responsiveness.

- **View Binding**: To simplify the view setup process, we use View Binding, eliminating the need to manually inflate views.

- **Coil**: Image loading is made effortless with Coil. It caches and loads images seamlessly into ImageViews for an optimal user experience.

- **Cloud Firestore**: In addition to Firebase Firestore, we utilize Cloud Firestore to enhance data synchronization and provide real-time updates, ensuring your app always displays the latest information.

MyApp is designed to deliver a user-friendly experience while utilizing these cutting-edge technologies. Dive into the code and explore how these components work together to create a robust Android app.
